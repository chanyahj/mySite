<p>Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state
    known for its rattlers. But baby rattlesnakes are born in July and August,
    making these two months especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children
    and others at high risk of exposure to rattlesnake bites.</p>

<p>So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the
    Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of
    Arizona College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of
    Arizona with the exception of Maricopa County, providing free and
    confidential poison and medication information to callers around the
    clock.</p>
<p>Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls
    from Arizonans of all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a rattler.
    The poison center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting, pinch or
    bite while outdoors to immediately call the center at 800-222-1222.</p>
<p>"We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible
    snakebite or eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona
    Poison and Drug Information Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the
    medical treatment, the better the outcome, so calling us right away can
    make a very big difference for the victims and the medical teams treating
    them."</p>
<p>The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes
    to be aware of these five things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily
        camouflaged by brush and grass.</li>
    <li>Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there
        will be no infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.</li>
    <li>Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very
        dangerous if they bite a human.</li>
    <li>Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or
        while they are biting.</li>
    <li>It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified
        small cut or wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale
        rattle warning, people can be bitten without knowing what has happened
        until they notice their symptoms and attribute them to a snakebite.</li>
</ol>
